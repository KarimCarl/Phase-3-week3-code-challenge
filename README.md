# Product Review
 This is an e-commerce domain. We'll be focusing on the product reviews.

## Domain Model
We have three models: User, Review, and Product.
For our purposes, a Product has many Users, a User has many Productsâ€™ s, and a Review belongs to a User and to a Product.
Product - User is a many-to-many relationship.
<br>
The application allows creating, updating, and deleting(CRUD) objects of the three models, and performing various object relationship methods and aggregate methods.
